// data transfer object aka dto

// what is a dto?
object; carries data bw processes

// why dto?
earlier comm bw processes used remote interfaces (web services); where each call is expensive
each call increases round-trip time from client to server
to save calls - dto is used

// how dto saves calls
dto aggregates data of several calls and sends in one call

// diff bw dto, business objects and data access objects
doesn't contain anything else than storage and retrieval of own data; getters and setters

// does dto contain business logic?
no

// what is business logic?
real world business rules that determine how data is created; stored; changed
models real world business objects such as accounts; loans; inventories
eg: if amt in bank account is 0, then withdraw() will not work, and balance can never go negative

// where to use DTO?
where moving data bw processes goes though expensive remote calls
